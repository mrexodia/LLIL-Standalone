# binja-standalone-api

This is a proof-of-concept standalone implementation of [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja)'s LLIL. It uses the official [binaryninja-api](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api) repository without modifications. The goal is to leverage the open source architecture plugins in a standalone environment. There are no plans to implement MLIL/HLIL or other proprietary Binary Ninja features, you should [purchase a license](https://binary.ninja/purchase/). There will be no support provided for this repository.
